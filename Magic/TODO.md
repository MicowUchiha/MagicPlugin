# TODO

## 8.0

 - Map brush needs fixing. Probably best to have a list of material sets for it to use?
   - Will need to be able to match the current material to the correct set
   - Sets will have to get matched to colors
 - Wand brush migration? Fix up old brushes?
 - Config migration, a script to convert materials might be nice.
 - Schematics may be broken or not?
 - Torch action is probably broken? Setting direction of torches, choosing between wall and ground torch... 
 - Check book -> skull feature
 - Tag sign facing probably broken?
 - Check capture spell
 - Towny integration is broken

## 7.4
 
 - Unstashable wands aren't unstashable until held
 
 - Weird auto-targeting on gatling gun?
 
 - Add path 2nd parameter to enchant command to stop when reaching end of a path
 
 - Optional lore on wands to say which classes they work with
 - Option for Selector for switch class rather than unlock class
     
 - Update skill icon lore when armor updates (to take buffs into account)
 
 - Brushette requests damage reduction (as in subtract an amount)
 - Status effect system
   - Some way to temporarily modify properties that works with stacking and is guaranteed to undo
   - Invoke via action, similar to ModifyProperties (maybe extend from it)
   
## Attributes

 - Attributes can improve with rankup (spell purchase? need new progression mechanism...)
 - Also allow classes to define attribute global effects
   - Physical damage
   - Speed
   - Magic damage (physical versus magic- maybe allow other damage classes?)
   - Cooldowns
   - Max mana / regen
   - Mana costs
   - SP costs or SP earn bonuses
   - Attack speed
   - Damage protection
   - Anti-hunger
   
## Suggestions

 - Citadel integration: https://github.com/DevotedMC/Citadel

 - Cast location offset override per spell.
 - Flag to prevent putting SP in chests
 - Check knockback resistance in Velocity action, or add Mage knockback resistance.
 
 - Some way to reference spells from other spells without having to use a Command
   actions. Maybe a Cast action, or just some way to reference a set of actions
   instead of a whole spell.
 
 - Add an action to simulate the red screen you get while out of bounds. See:
   https://gist.github.com/leonardosnt/ffa8e72b60df197c762d1f2e903cc67f

 - MythicMob integration to add protection/strength/etc

 - Placeholder API integration: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/hooking-into-placeholderapi/
   - Allow placeholder-driven attributes
 
 - Mana regen cooldown, so that casting a spell puts mana regen on a cooldown
 
 - Paginate wand and spell lists

## On Hold

 - Casting blob on an item frame makes the frame disappear. User reports dropped frame, too, but could not reproduce.
 - Spells drop on death with lag (maybe)?
 - Spells can be worn .. ?  Skill icons maybe?
 - PerWorldInventory logout issues, can't reproduce
 - Broom issues when in creative mode
 - Cooldown reduction not working on wands, nor is the cooldown_reduction parameter working (could not reproduce.. ??)
 - Wand disappearing during duels- maybe via disarm, maybe drop action? (red 0 on PW)
 - PW would like some custom lore for wand "quiet" and quick cast settings.
 - Recall warps don't show up with /mage describe?
   
## Fast Blocks

 - The easiest way to deal with that is to probably pretend the client doesn't have the chunk yet
 - just entityplayer.playerConnection.sendPacket(new PacketPlayOutMapChunk(this.chunk, '\uffff')); should work
 - or even easier .. set the dirtyCount of the player chunk to 64, and update the h field with the chunk sections that you modified
 - and make sure to call playerChunkMap.a(playerChunk); to schedule an update

  https://github.com/tastybento/askyblock/blob/master/src/com/wasteofplastic/askyblock/nms/v1_12_R1/NMSHandler.java
  
## Not so High-Priority
 
 - Destroyed a car with someone in it, they stayed in invisible car
 - Per-player language settings (See https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/api-languages.22305/)
 - Would be cool to have a configurable max # of maps, and start re-using map ids when limit is hit, LRU
 - Ability to alter flower pots and beds (need to tweak TileEntity data.. doable, but messy to track with Material keys)
 - Brush selector on a sub-page for beds says "diamond axe sub-types"?
 - An option on a wand to put all spells at max level (but don't fill)
 - Aliases don't work with levels 
 - Ability to specify map dimensions/offset in percentage

## Sabers

 - Paths being able to upgrade blocking/reflect power

### Suggestions

 - Bonuses to wands:
   - If you could do this with a command like "/wand configure mana_regen/max_mana <amount in seconds>" would be great as I could make my own shops for this
   - Also by combining in an anvil with an item that has these buffs that you can add to your wand
     - Temporary max mana
     - Temporary faster mana regeneration
     - Temporary anything else you can think of really, the more we can add, the better :)
 - Upgrades to Spells
   - Can only choose 1 of the 3 and only when applicable (actual bonus could be customized)
   - Bonus to max distance x2
   - Bonus to travel speed of the spell 40% faster
   - 10% bonus to damage
 - Ability to set the max amount of spells that a wand can have
 - With the ability to add/remove spells to your list
   - bonus to that would be if you could set a configurable cooldown for being able to change out the spells on your wand
 - If you add permanent bonuses I think it should work more like rune stones with the ability to add certain bonuses to specific armor pieces in the way you would add an enchant to an item. This would allow you to add the buffs to existing armor that already has enchants on them. This would allow for creating an economy around these buffs as you would need to eventually obtain more rune stones to enchant more armor. You could possibly even have a whitelist/blacklist of items that could/could not be enchanted with the rune stone. Of course these buffs would all have to do with making you a better wand caster that fit with the Magic plugin theme.
 - Chance to fizzle should only happen if you have been cursed (I saw a spell that say's reduced chance of fizzle)
 
## Older stuff

 - MagicArenas: Doesn't TP players out on a draw.. ?
 - Getting hit with aqua erecto says "cast unknown" on you?
 - Admission+Break door = dupe door (thought this was fixed???)
 - Grow/Shrink doesn't work on rabbits?
 - Put a size cap on slimes with Grow
 	
 - Shops/Items:
   - Add new command, mshop
     - /mshop create [shoptype] [title] : Create a new shop NPC, default type "buyshop" in configs
     - /mshop add [worth] <add item in hand to shop, or update worth if present>
     - /mshop remove <remove item in hand from shop>
     - Should look up itemstack (with count of 1) first, save as key if found
     - Eventually a GUI would be nice.
 
 - Alter/grow/shrink/rollback should prevent mobs dropping loot
 
 - Use Entity tags ("Tags" tag, NBTList, see nms.Entity.P()) for tracking magic mobs
 
 - See if snow that falls on something undoable can undo?
 - lingering potions
 
 - Undo bugs with pistons.. yuck. https://youtu.be/S-d-XT2r_vM
 
 - Casting while standing on a gold pressure plate doesn't work :|
 - Arenas preventing last death Recall isn't working?
 - Some kind of gliding-without-Elytra mechanic involving cancelling the glide event?
 - Spell count limit on wands or paths?
 
 - Trying to place a block with a wand in the offhand is super glitchy
 
 - Show mana from offhand wand (if no wand in main hand)
 - Account for offhand items in "armor" checks
 - Add builtin "help" command, check messaging for missing commands- shows "no permission"?
 - Expand armor to include power, other modifiers?
 
 - "Triggered" spells.. ? Apparently MagicSpells does this or somesuch.
   Examples- Activated spells/ passive spells Upon taking damage- activate a heal spell effect Upon dealing damage- explosion in line of sight

 - I think action-specific parameters should not inherit down. Might be a tricky change.
 - Add wand appearance shop

 - Add option to only cast spells when damaging an entity

 - Can still drop your wand by holding while closing your inv
 - Spell organization by path?

 - Pull/Accio on top of an entity sends it skyrocketing
 - Column's radius doesn't seem to work
   
 - CoreProtect integration
   http://minerealm.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=16362

 - PS TODO:
   - Fix formatting of allowed list, single-column
   - Limit on repeat rentals of a plot

 - Add effects template, for wands to stay one template but act like another (? - for cane)
 - Prevent TNT breaking secured chests

 - There's an area in the RoR where you can cast alohomora and it will spawn doors, in the center of the right side when you enter~
 - Need to fix some door-related undo issues, e.g. casting admission then breaking door sometimes drops door

 - Fix block targeting cast messages

 - Fix that horrible inv-dupe issue :(
 
 - Add spell or brush or something to auto-convert from MagicWorlds configs
 
 - Try to support projectile hitbox modifiers that aren't cubes
 
 - Overrides with commas in them are broken again
 
 - Reducto hay blocks in the PW park, some drop :|

 - Spells acting oddly with Copy - Box, Iterate

 - Don't logout players on server change until they quit

 - Undo action re-work
   - Incorporate UndoBatch into Undo action
     - Make sure to handle special cases, non-cancellable

 - Re-work "active", "deactivate" and "cancel" behaviors?

 - Lead on possible undo issue- undo another player's spell while building, it still builds another tick or so?

 - Spell lore should reflect reduced cooldowns
 - Goggles deactivate on death (maybe only in Azkaban?)
 - Can we save 1 slot in wand inv?
 - Test out silent firework entities
 - Test baby/giant wither bosses:
   You have to set (every tick) the invulnerability of the wither.
   Either you get the data watcher and watch 20 with a value big but below than 1000. I use 600 not to have a too small wither. But there is an easier method which is r() which does it.
   ((CraftWither)wither).getHandle().r(600);
 - Need a way for /cast to be cooldown-free without affecting NPC's, etc.
   - Add list of cast-command params?
   - Would be nice to replace the current toggleCastCommand stuff, but need something special for NPCs.. ?
 - Aliases are broken /wand add doesn't activate, spell items don't work

 - Show countdown in hotbar for duration-based or active-cost spells
 - Add templates to messages.yml for all the various forms a wand and spell
   name can take.

 - Can't hitbox-target entities standing in a corner? Issues with spiders?
 - Look at/expand "item" parameter to SpawnEntity (why do wither skellies start with a bow?)
 - Add "drops" parameter to Damage action to prevent mobs dropping loot.

 - Add /mmap reload command

 - Hover text for spells
 - Cat GIF generator? http://catdb.yawk.at/images?tag=gif
 - Check Regenerate - got stuck, couldn't cancel?
 - Make Portal spell portals avoid creating a frame on the other side (maybe handle TP'ing on portal event?)
 - Logout on death still buggy? (can not reproduce)
 - Wand dupe issue: tl;dr : he was able to drag a wand while in the spell inventory.

 - Clean up MaterialBrush target system, automate somehow?
 - Copy target brush action for tandem replication
 - Automata aren't cleaning up cmd block + redstone
 - Automata don't re-activate un chunk load events (?)
 - Glitching Fill behavior
 - Spell shop improvements:
   - Color spells player can't afford
   - Some sort of ability to set up in-game?
   - Add alphabetize option to base shop (hrm, no, config is a map.. bleh)
   - Allow air as filler blocks
 - Trait improvements
   - Add /parameter command for inspecting single param
 - Nerf Force (shift to break free? Fall protection?)
 - Make map work like replicate, clone - with start point set on activate
   - and maybe not repeat
 - Add repeat option for schematic brushes
   - or generalized option that works with map, too
 - /magic describe should show info about current spell?

## Old Stuff

 - Arena spell/schematic
 - Magic stats (that persist) - block modified, etc. (Statistics API?)
 - Collapse blocklist chains on save (?)
 - Enchant count limit for wands
 - EnderDragon familiars that don't do block damage or spawn a portal on death?

## NEW SPELLS

 - level - levels the ground
 - avatar - Goes into "avatar" state- free spells, super power, levitating, special effects- but rapidly decreasing mana while active.
    - will need a spell-based power/protection system, or use potion effects? 
    - would be nice if this could extend from potioneffect and levitate- maybe refactor?
    - will need a separate "active cost reduction" property
 - banish - sets a player's home and spawn?
 - Fix/finish stairs spell
 - Fix tunnel spell
 - Some kind of "ramp" version of fill, like stairs but with arbitrary blocks?
 - Disguise spells / clone spell
 - Biome modification (mega-frost).
 - Decorate, places paintings at target

## OTHER STUFF
 
 - Customize dynmap map wand pop-ups? Red with black shadows looked cool.. use wand effect color?
 - Make volley multi-sample?
 - Alter names sheep "jeb_", - others "Dinnerbone" ?
 
 - Fix up alter spell, remove id-based lists
 
 - Need separate activate/deactivate costs. Fill vs levitate :\
   - Variable costs would be nice, too- for fill and superconstruct.
 - prevent pillar from passing through non-air blocks of different materials than the target
 - If possible, label more material data like stair direction.
 - Add locale option to suffix messages.yml
 
 - Show active spells in a different color

 - Continue work on combining wands on anvils
 
## TESTING / TWEAKING:
 
 - Test larger undo queue sizes, or count size in blocks?
 - Add console logging of massive construction spell casting

## STACK TRACES / EXTRA DEBUG INFO
